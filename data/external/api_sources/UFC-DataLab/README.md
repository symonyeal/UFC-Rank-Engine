# 🥊 UFC Data Lab – Comprehensive UFC Fights Dataset & Analysis  
UFC is the **largest MMA promotion** in the world, it is in the top 5-10 sports promotions in the US, and **growing**! It **outgrew** such leagues as the NBA, F1, Champions League, NHL, NFL, MLB, and others in terms of relative pct growth over the last 7 years.

This repository is a complete **UFC fights dataset** project containing every single **UFC fight**, **fighter stats**, and official **fight scorecards**.  

Data was scraped, **OCR-parsed** from scorecard images (using [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR)), cleaned, and preprocessed for analysis. Finally, the data was explored through **EDA-driven storytelling** and summarized in a **presentation of key findings**.

## 📊 Project Outcomes  
By the end of this project, the following were achieved:  
✔️ UFC fight stats scraped  
✔️ UFC scorecards scraped  
✔️ Scorecards OCR-parsed  
✔️ Dataset cleaned & preprocessed  
✔️ Final dataset organized for analysis  
✔️ EDA questions posed & answered  
✔️ Results presented in a clear report  

## 🔄 Dataset Updates
The datasets are updated every 3 months to include the latest UFC events.

## 📁 Dataset Outputs
- `data/stats/stats_raw.csv` contains the scraped all-bouts UFC Stats export, including decisive fights, draws, and no contests.
- `data/stats/stats_processed.csv` is the decisive-only analytical table built around winner/loser and delta features.
- `data/stats/stats_processed_all_bouts.csv` is the canonical processed all-bouts table that preserves `red/blue` columns and adds `fight_outcome`.
- `data/merged_stats_n_scorecards/merged_stats_n_scorecards.csv` is the all-bouts stats-plus-scorecards merge and carries `fight_outcome`.
